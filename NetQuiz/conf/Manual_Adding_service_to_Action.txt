Adding a new service to an action

Example: 
Add QuestionService to QuizAction

1. Add new private class variable to QuizAction with setter method:
	private QuestionService questionService;
	
	public void setQuestionService(QuestionService questionService) {
	        this.questionService = questionService;
    	}

2. Modify QuizActionTest Unit test
	1.1 Add new private class variable:
		private QuestionService questionService;
		
	1.2 Mock object in setUp method:
		questionService = (QuestionService)mock(QuestionService.class);
	
	1.3 Set service to Action in setUp() method:
		quizAction.setQuestionService(questionService);
		
	1.4 In the tests where this service is used then methods invoked have to be specified (Look for examples in the code). 
	    Make sure you use startVerification() method in the test, for more info google RMock
	
3. Modify Spring file so that Actions is linked to the service

    <bean id="quizAction" scope="prototype" class="se.netlight.netquiz.quiz.action.QuizAction">
        <property name="questionService" ref="questionService"></property>
    </bean>
